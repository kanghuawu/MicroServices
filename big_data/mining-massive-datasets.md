## Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

### Definition

Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is an algorithm for solving the approximate or exact Near Neighbor Search in high dimensional spaces.

### Application

* Near-duplicate detection
* Genome-wide association study
* Large-scale image search: Google used LSH along with PageRank to build their image search technology VisualRank.
* Audio/video fingerprinting
